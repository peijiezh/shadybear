                <h3>Notification of Claimed Copyright Infringement</h3>
                <p>If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our copyright agent with the following information:</p>

                    <li>An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;</li>

                    <li>A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the site (providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly);</li>

                    <li>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
                    <li>A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Our designated copyright agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement can be reached at:</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@shadybears.online">support@shadybears.online</a><br>

                </p>
                
                <h3>Counter-Notification Procedures</h3>
                <p>If you believe that your content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to our copyright agent:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
                    <li>Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
                    <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and</li>
                    <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in the district where you reside, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>If a counter-notice is received by our copyright agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
                
                <h3>Repeat Infringers</h3>
                <p>It is our policy in appropriate circumstances to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.</p>
                
                <h3>Modifications to Policy</h3>
